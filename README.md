# NumberSystem
A calculator that will show you a decimal number presented in both binary and hexadecimal

While working on a larger project, I needed a subroutine to convert numbers into binary. While I generally prefer C++ or Java, both are limited by their numerical data types. In both of these languages, the maximum value for an integer is shy of 5 trillion (5x10^12) with an unsigned long. My larger project is working with numbers significantly greater such as n > 10^50 which are numbers I can't even theoretically count to. As I was working on developing a new data type and calculator to manage these values, it was explained to me that one advantage of python is that there is no limit to the size of an integer that python can hold. This would save me hours or maybe even days of time in programming a new data type and calculator in C++.  
While I generally try to avoid python due to the fact that it's dynamically typed, and its appalling execution speed, I found that python would be an optimal choice in this scenario.

While my .py file can be found on this repository, an executable will be coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to view the screenshots below.
